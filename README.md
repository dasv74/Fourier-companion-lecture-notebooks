># Lecture Companion Notebooks

## Introduction to Multidimensional Fourier Transform
*Daniel Sage — École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)*

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed as a direct complement to a lecture on Fourier image processing. The notebooks focus on visual intuition, frequency-domain reasoning with many illustrations.

## Scope

- Fourier decomposition of images, Fourier-based reconstruction and demonstrations of Fourier properties
- Convolution and deconvolution in the frequency domain
- Experiment basic Super-Resolution SIM Reconstruction (Structured Illumination Microscopy)

## Intended use

- Lecture companion material for in-class demonstrations
- Practical sessions for revision
  
These notebooks are not meant to replace a theoretical lecture, but to make abstract Fourier concepts concrete and visually intuitive.

## Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.9
- numpy
- scikit-image
- matplotlib
- ipywidgets
- notebooks

All notebooks run in a standard Jupyter environment.
